# scripts/preflight_test.sh — self-test for scripts/preflight.sh.
#
# The preflight is now the ONLY gate between a broken or vulnerable tree and
# production (there is no CI to catch what it misses), so its own failure modes
# matter as much as the gates it runs. A gate runner that can be talked into a
# green result is worse than no gate, because it produces evidence that looks
# real. This proves the safety properties, and it is cheap: every check here
# either inspects the script's own selection logic or runs a gate that fails
# fast, so no full build/test is ever triggered.
#
# Run:  ./scripts/preflight_test.sh
# Exit: 0 if every property holds, 1 on the first violation.
#
# CALLER: the `selftest` gate of scripts/preflight.sh (and `make preflight-selftest`).
# It MUST have one. Until 2026-09-21 it had none, and two checks rotted silently
# for exactly that reason: check 1 had stopped testing anything (its hardcoded
# skip-list predated the `tmpkey` gate, so `tmpkey` still ran, the run went
# green and the all-skipped branch was never reached) and the --list expectation
# was a hardcoded 9 names against 10 real gates. A regression net nobody runs is
# not a net.
#
# NO HARDCODED GATE INVENTORY: every gate name used below is derived from the
# script under test — `--list` for the inventory, the `run <name>` call sites for
# the gates that can actually execute. Adding gate #11 therefore cannot retire
# check 1 or trip a stale expectation, and check 2 fails if the two sources ever
# disagree (a gate listed but never run is a silent coverage loss: --only selects
# it, nothing executes, and the summary still reads green).
#
# THE SANDBOX USES A COPY OF preflight.sh, ON PURPOSE. The copy's repo root is
# the sandbox, which is what makes the properties testable without a real build:
# the script's own repo-root resolution runs for real, and each gate command that
# would be expensive finds its prerequisite missing and fails fast. Because a
# copy cannot prove anything about the LIVE file, check 1 re-runs the all-skipped
# property against the real scripts/preflight.sh from the real repo root — same
# derived skip-list, no hardcoding there either.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT, NOT `go test`: the properties are about a shell
# script's argument handling and exit codes, not about Go packages, and the
# people who need to run this (a deployer mid-incident) have a shell, not
# necessarily a working Go toolchain pointed at this repo.
